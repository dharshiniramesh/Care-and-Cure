#### JAVA 

This application is written in Java.

- [Java]( https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java)
 
- [Servlet]( https://github.com/topics/java-servlets)

- [MYSQL]( https://github.com/mysql)

The application uses multi threading in order to process events asynchronously.
	
	- Session was created when the user login to the application.
	
	- Session will notify the each process and store it temporarly.
